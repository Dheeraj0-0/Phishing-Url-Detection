## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) must be installed on your machine.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git)
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```

2.  **Build the Docker image:**
    This command builds the image and runs the `retrain.py` script inside the container to create a compatible `model.pkl` file.
    ```bash
    docker build -t phishing-detector .
    ```

3.  **Run the Docker container:**
    This command starts the application and maps your local port 8000 to the container's port 5000.
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8000:5000 phishing-detector
    ```

4.  **Access the application:**
